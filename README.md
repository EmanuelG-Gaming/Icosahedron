# Icosahedron
A game engine that uses OpenGL for graphics. It is supposed to be for both 2D and 3D applications.

# Extensions
Right now, Icosahedron has the `Physics` and `UI` extensions.

# Building the code:
For some, this can be pretty straightforward, but here it is:

## Visual studio code (VScode):
### On Windows:
- Download the C/C++ extension on [their website](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools), and CMake  tools might come in handy;
- Install MingW with CMake;
- Clone this repository;
- Open Visual Studio Code;
- Write some code or use an example;
- Build the project;
- Run it.

(Assuming you've got a C++ compiler, and a computer with OpenGL >= 3.0 support)

If you've managed to build this project successfully, you may see a `build` folder being created, with something like `icosahedron-main.exe` or `icosahedron-examples.exe`. You can run either `.\build\icosahedron-main` or `.build\icosahedron-examples` on the terminal, and these will start your application.
