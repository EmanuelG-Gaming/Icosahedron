# Icosahedron
A game engine that uses OpenGL for graphics. It is supposed to be for both 2D and 3D applications.

# TODO:

- Add support for multiple windows in one application. ( )
- Add built-in checkboxes, sliders, text fields and dialogs via the ic::UI extension. (in progress) 
- Make event-driven programming accept multiple parameters in functions and also allow it to use methods from classes. ( )
- Add more math functions. (in progress)
- Allow raycasting for 3D boxes. ( )
